#PMPH_Server / (Portable Micro Python HTTP Server) / 'pimp' server

###PMPH is a small httpd that I wrote to use on dev boxes and laptops with limited space.
###Supports GET content types: html, css, xml, images, json, js, png, gif, and jpg.

#Try it!
##Go to demo/ and run the demo.py script to see it in action, it will tell you the local ip of the machine it's running on if you'd like to use it remotely
##Server runs on 0.0.0.0 for remote access and listens on port 80, you can change this if you have apache or something going on that port.
