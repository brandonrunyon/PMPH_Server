#TODO
*Need multithreading to serve to multiple client requests
*Further investigate MIME support requirements
*Refactor into multiple classes using demo.py as a starting place
*Investigate .SWF/Flash support (related to MIME maybe?)
*Start on POST support using do_POST method from BaseHTTPRequest class
*It would be nice to make some sort of web admin interface to maybe change values and restart the server or block IPs
    -perhaps add ftp?
*Investigate SSL for server

##Feel free to just jump in there and start doing stuff... I'm interested in feed back, probably after i've designed the classes
